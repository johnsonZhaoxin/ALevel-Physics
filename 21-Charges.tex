\section{Leadin}
One of the most important application from physics must be the electricity. You've been in great debt to star physicists for bringing currents to daily life, such as Coulomb Faraday, Tesla, Guass, Ampere, Volta, etc. Without their theories and patents orginates from them, The modern life with convenience will never exsit.

\end{marginfigure}

\section{Discovery of charges}
Before we investigate on the currents, let's look at how charges are discovered and defined.
\subsection{Charge by friction}
Around 600 BC, \href{https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thales-of-Miletus}{Thales of Miletus} rubbed \emph{amber}\footnote{exp:} with a cloth which caused attraction of lightweight particles, it is the basis for discovery of electric charges. and electricity comes from the greek word-``$\eta\lambda\epsilon\kappa\tau\rho o\nu$'', elektron in English, but stands for amber. 
%泰勒斯，西方第一个哲学家
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{auxi/amberfriction.jpg}
\caption{after rubbing amber with cloth, the amber will be charged.}
\end{figure}
\begin{TaskBox}
Will the cloth be charged as well?
\end{TaskBox}

\subsection{Electroscope}
By putting an object close to/ or touches the metal plate of the \href{https://orau.org/health-physics-museum/collection/electroscopes/electrostatic/beetz-cylindrical.html}{electroscope}, if the alumimum foil repels and expands, that shows the object is charged.
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{auxi/electroscope.jpg}
\caption{a cylindrical Beetz-type electroscope, inveted in 1873}
\end{marginfigure}

\begin{TaskBox}
Instead of amber, we now use two types of rubbing pair, silk and glass rod; fur and plastic rod. Try to illustrate the two types of charging. And use electroscope to show that the materials carry charges. 
\end{TaskBox}

\subsection{Franklin's Contribution}
\href{https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/kite-key-experiment}{Benjamin Franklin} is not only the founding father of USA, but also a great and adventurous physicist for his famous \href{https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/did-benjamin-franklin-use-kite-to-discover-electricity.htm}{kite experiment}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{auxi/Franklin.jpg}
\caption{Franklin, A man catching the lightning in 1752}
\end{figure}
And his observations and letters between him and Peter Collison was recorded in ``\href{http://www.benjamin-franklin-history.org/experiments-with-electricity/#:~:text=Experiments%20with%20electricity%201%20The%20Leyden%20Jar%20The,Franklin’s%20letters%20about%20his%20experiments%20with%20electricity%20}{Experiments and Observations on Electricity}''
\begin{marginfigure}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{auxi/Experiments-and-Observation-on-Electricity.jpg}
\caption{Coverpage of the Experiments and Observation on Electricity}
\end{marginfigure}
By conducting the kite experiment Franklin proved that lighting was an electrical discharge and realized that it can be charged over a conductor into the ground providing a safe alternative path and eliminating the risk of deadly fires.
And that ``Philadelphia experiment'' has led to the invention of lightning rod, as well as the understanding of \textbf{postive} and \textbf{negative} charges.

\subsection{Thomson's Contribution}
Sir Joseph John Thomson, who also attended Trinity College from Cambridge University, won the 1906 Nobel Prize for his discovery of ``\emph{Cathode Ray}'' 
\begin{marginfigure}[3cm] %offset 3cm
\includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{auxi/thomson.jpg}
\caption{J.J. Thomson\\1856-1920}
\end{marginfigure}
which has brought people to the way of dividing atoms into sub-atomic level. He was also famous for his ``\emph{plum pudding model}''\footnote{the model is not correct, but still meaningful}. Hence, the hero in explaining why objects are neutral, or why sometimes they can be charged, or why there are postive charges and negative charges is finally revealing its veils- the \emph{electron}.

\subsection{Microscopic Explaination}
Now,the explaination has finally comes:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
  \item Everything is consist of various \uline{\hspace{1in}}
  \item any atom has \uline{\hspace{1in}}, and most importantly, in the outside, atom has lots electrons.
  \item electron is \uline{(postively/negatively)} charged. while \uline{\hspace{1in}} is postively charged.
  \item Both electron and proton has \uline{same amount of charge}, but one is negative the other is positve.
  \item Task: Explain why most objects are neutral
  \vspace{0.6in}
  \item Electrons are easier to move away from the attraction of nucleus, provided enough energy is transferred to the atom, such energy can be obtained by \uline{rubbing the object}
  \item Task: Explain why rubbing can cause charging.
  \vspace{0.6in} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Charge Carriers}
In a wire made of metal, the \uline{\hspace{1in}} are free to move, thus the charge carriers are the electrons.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{auxi/seaofelectrons.png}
\caption{Sea of electrons exist in metal}
\end{figure}

In a solution, it is not electron but the \emph{Cations} and \emph{Anions}\footnote{def:} can move if electric field\footnote{it is another topic} is applied. In this case, the ions are the charge carriers.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{auxi/ions.jpg}
\caption{ions are charge carriers in a solution}
\end{figure}

\begin{TaskBox}
Using the concept of ions, explain why they can carry charges, and how to determine the amount of charges they carry accroding to the symbol? e.g. \ce{Mg^2+},\ce{Cl^-},\ce{CrO4^2-} etc.
\vspace{1in} 
\end{TaskBox}

\subsection{Elementary Charge}
\href{https://owlcation.com/stem/Millikans-Oil-Drop-Experiment#:~:text=Millikan%27s%20oil-drop%20experiment%20was%20performed%20by%20Robert%20Millikan,groups%20%28or%20the%20absence%20of%20groups%29%20of%20electrons.}{Millikan} has devised a delicate experiment\footnote{oil drop experiment, the result of which is not accurate at first, but has been greatly improved by other young scientists.} to deterimine the charge of electrons. And the amount of charge that an electron carries is \uline{\hspace{1in}}. The unit is \uline{\hspace{1in}}

Such charge is called ``\emph{elemenatary charge}'' or ``\emph{fundamental charge}'' and is denoted as $-e$ and a proton has equal amount of charge but is positive, and therefore can be denoted as $+e$ or $e$.
